Dataset 1:
Analysis

The confusion matrix tells us how well the model is predicting each class. For example, the model successfully predicted 437 instances of Class 1 as Class 1, but it had 6 instances of Class 1 miss-classified as Class 2. The same pattern is repeated for all the other classes, indicating where the model is doing well and where it is making an error. It also displays class-specific challenges in the matrix, misclassifying for Class 5, which is scarcely represented by examples and could be leading to poor performance by this model.

Classification Report:
The classification report includes precision, recall, and the F1 score for each of the classes, as given below:.
Class 1: Model precision was 0.89, meaning 89% of the instances posited as being in Class 1 by the model were actually in Class 1. A recall of 0.93 implies that 93% of real instances of Class 1 were well identified. The same F1-score of 0.91 gives a better tradeoff between model precision and recall.
Class 2: The high performing, high-scored class has high precision—0.98—and recall—0.98, which brings a very high F1-score of 0.98.
Class 3: The model performance was really very good, with a precision of 0.99 and recall of 1.00, thus giving an F1-score of 1.00.
Class 4 with a precision of 0.92 and a recall of 0.99 has an F1 score of 0.95, which is very high, hence showing good performance. Class 5: The model performance on class 5 is pretty poor, with a precision of 0.40, recall of 0.18, and F1-score of 0.25; hence, the model does not perform very well in correctly predicting class 5.
Classes 6, 7, 8, and 9 described a high precision, recall, and F1-scores, which means that the model went well across these categories.

Overall Performance: On the other hand, general accuracy reaches 95%, which is indicative of strong performance across the dataset. The remaining performance measures are: macro average F1-score, 0.86, indicating that most of them are generally well performed and averaging across all classes, treating each class equally regardless of its frequency; weighted average F1-score, 0.95, showing how effective the model is when considering the distribution of the instances across different classes. The overall performance of the logistic regression model is brilliant, but it does very poorly in Class 5 due to the fact that this class is grossly underrepresented in the database.

On the subject of classification, if one is told that "Class 0 contains no positive samples, Class 1 does, and Class 2 does," then there is a serious problem either with the dataset or the way in which testing has been conducted. More specifically, Class 0 has no instances that are positive labeled in the test set, meaning there are no samples for this class that could be appraised as true recognized positives. This absence precludes the computation of some performance metrics—particularly, the ROC curve and AUC for Class 0—since these require at least some positive samples to quantify how well a model is distinguishing between positive and negative cases. On the other hand, Classes 1 and 2 have positive samples to calculate these metrics and, therefore, indicate how accurately the model is classifying instances of these classes. A scenario such as this suggests a possible imbalance, or there could be an issue with the manner in which the data distribution has been designed—that is, Class 0 is underrepresented or not part of the test data.
